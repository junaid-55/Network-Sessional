With my back on the floor
Cold linoleum icing my growing pains
Watch the ceiling fan turn its shape again
My threads are coming loose
Yeah, I'm one spoon away
From setting the ends of my hair on fire
If I'm kindling for a little while
At least I'd feel of use
Maybe then my breath could embody
A wildfire starting
I'd sweep up the forest floor
And my body'd breathe life into the corners
Be a darker soil
